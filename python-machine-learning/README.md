# Python Machine Learning Projects

### Collection of various Python Machine Learning models I implement in order to train data and make predictions on the categorial features of datasets.

### *My 2 Capstone projects for this Machine Learning are the Natural-Language-Processing and Neural-Nets-&-Deep-Learning files*
More information about my capstone projects can be found in those files!

Skills Demonstrated:
* Machine Learning with SciKit Learn, including:
* Linear Regression
* K Nearest Neighbors
* K Means Clustering
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Natural Language Processing
* Neural Nets and Deep Learning
* Support Vector Machines
