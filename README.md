# Krish Chanda Project Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub repository, an immersive showcase of my passion for coding and problem-solving! Here, you will find a diverse range of projects that demonstrate my skills and expertise in various programming languages, including Python, C++, Java, and MySQL. 

## Python Machine Learning

Using Python, I have leveraged the power of various libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Sklearn, TensorFlow, Keras) to conduct exploratory data analysis and build Machine Learning algorithms. Preview of Projects shown below: 

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project: 
Given a dataset of Yelp reviews from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013), I implemented an NLP model using the Python sklearn library in order to determine based on a review, whether it was positive (5-star) or negative (1-star).

### Project Overview
* Graph distributions of each Yelp review by stars (1-5) and text length
* Find if any strong correlations lie in the data using a heatmap
* Separate the data into train/test splits & use CountVectorizer() function to remove any stopwords from the reviews
* Implement and train a Pipeline model that uses a MultinomialNB classifier and Tf-idf transformer
* Create a classification report & confusion matrix to determine the accuracy of the model

### Recurrent Neural Net (RNN) Project:
Given a dataset from Kaggle for [loan details](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club), I use exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, and an RNN model using TensorFlow to determine if a person would be able to pay off a loan (loan_status column) given other factors.

### Project Overview:
* Use scatterplots, count-plots,  and heatmaps to find correlations within the dataset
* Analyze missing data and either normalize or delete them based on correlations with non-empty cols
* Create dummy variables for the remaining columns for the training algorithm
* Drop columns that give no useful information
* Separate data into train/test splits and create scale the data using a MinMaxScaler() function
* Use Tensorflow to create a Recurrent Neural Network model
* Fit the model with the train data and make predictions using test split & plot model history performance
* Create a classification report & confusion matrix to determine the accuracy of the model
