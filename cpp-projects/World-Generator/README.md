# World_generator Project
In this 2 part C++ program, I create a program where a user can customize a 2-D game board where they can add their player icon and enemies.

## World Builder (wb)
In this program, the user can create their game map and save it as a .txt file.

## Game Engine (ge)
This program takes in the .txt file from the previous program and outputs the game map onto the console.

## Example Output
..........

.XXX..XXX.

.XWX..XBXX

.XX....XX.

..X.K..X..

..X....X..

.XX....XX.

.XTX..XLXX

.XXX..XXX.
