# World_generator Project
In this 2 part C++ program, I create a program where a user can customize a 2-D game board where they can add their player icon and enemies.

## World Builder (wb)
In this program, the user can create their game map and save it as a .txt file.

## Game Engine (ge)
This program takes in the .txt file from the previous program and outputs the game map onto the console.

## Example Output
.......... <br />
.XXX..XXX. <br />
.XWX..XBXX <br />
.XX....XX. <br />
..X.K..X.. <br />
..X....X.. <br />
.XX....XX. <br />
.XTX..XLXX <br />
.XXX..XXX. <br />
.......... <br />
